Final Project: Pocket Tanks 3D
Description: A two player game based on tank warfare. The primary goal of the game is to eliminate your opponent. You have the ability to control your tank's position, targeting, and firepower. Using these tools you must outmatch and destroy your opponents tank!
Primary features
  1. Tank object will include a turret that can rotate 360ยบ(can even fire through its own base, basically a full sphere of range with only the environment in the way) Once you have chosen the position of the turret you choose your firepower. This combined with the angle of the turret will determine the trajectory of the shell. Tanks will have a certain amount of hit-points and once depeleted they are eliminated.
   2. Environment. The tanks will be spawned in a map that will hopefully be randomly generated everytime. I hope to be able to have a user-setting for the map where you can make your map a flat terrain, a mountain, or a canyon. Then they could potentially adjust other features if there is time to develop them. The maps will be destructable, a shot that hits the ground will leave a crater and it is possible to take cover behind the ground.
